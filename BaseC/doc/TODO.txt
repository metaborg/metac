Decide on:
- expression construct names:
	- all the same name seems to be not specific enough
	- Usually CommaExpressions allowed.
	- In the case of a switch statement only ConstantExpressions (no assigns and no comma's) are allowed
	- any other exceptions?

- variable number of arguments (like printf).
	- Is it safe enough to get into SafeC?
