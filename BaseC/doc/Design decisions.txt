=== BaseC Syntax Definition ===
TODO: add explaination why no fundec and only fundefs.

== Constants ==

= Constant Notation =
C99 and mbeddr have different ways of specificying hex, oct and bin constants.
It was decided to have BaseC according to C99, because the mbeddr syntax is primarily focussed
on the projectional editing.
Constant strings are wrapped by quotes (see messagelist) to be closer to the standard C way


== Expressions ==

= Expression Construct Names =
Expression Constructor names are not all different as in the C syntax specification.
Spoofax has precedence rules, so we dont need to encode those in different constructor names.
However, in some cases an explicit subset of the expressions is needed (for example, the case
in a switch statement allows all expressions except assignments and comma's).
For those cases a different constructor name is required.


== Statements ==

= Assignments =
We decided to be more restrictive on assignment expressions. An assignment can now only be done
to an identifier. This is safer. (Will probably be less restrictive in the future).

== Interfaces ==

= Pre and postconditions = 
There is no number associated to the pre or post condition because we do not have support from a 
projectional editor

== User defined data types ==

= Struct and unions =
It is allowed having a multideclaration (int8 x,y,z) inside a struct or a union.
